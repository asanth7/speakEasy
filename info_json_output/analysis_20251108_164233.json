Neither slouching nor excessive shifting is observed, indicating a consistent and focused demeanor.\n\n**Hand Gestures:**\nThe subject's gestures are varied, dynamic, and generally supportive in conveying the message or engaging with the audience/camera. While some hand gestures can be perceived as natural and expressive, they are not overly distracting or repetitive.\n\n**Eye Contact:**\nThe subject consistently engages directly with the camera or audience, maintaining eye contact. This suggests a strong connection with the viewer, emphasizing active participation and interest in maintaining engagement.\n\n**Facial Expression:**\nFacial expressions are appropriate and expressive for the context, often conveying confidence, enthusiasm, or engagement.

    "question": "\nYou are an expert debate coach in ENGLISH (output in ENGLISH). Based on the user’s video input, can you evaluate their delivery for each frame using the following categories, giving a rating of \"high\", \"medium\", or \"low\" for each?\n\n- Posture: Are they standing confidently, balanced, and upright, or do they lean, slouch, sway, or shift excessively?\n- Hand Gestures: Are gestures natural, supportive, and purposeful, or are they distracting, repetitive, rigid, or minimal?\n- Eye Contact: Do they maintain consistent engagement with the audience/camera, or do they look away too often, down, or off-screen?\n- Vocal Intensity: Is their vocal delivery confident, clear, well-projected, and dynamic, or is it monotone, overly aggressive, or lacking presence?\n- Facial Expression: Are their expressions expressive and aligned with their message, or are they flat, tense, or inconsistent?\n- Overall Presence: Do they appear persuasive, confident, focused, and engaged?\n\nAdditionally, can you evaluate the speaker in terms of:\n- Intensity (energy and emotional impact)\n- Confidence (steadiness, comfort, assertiveness)\n- Presence (audience engagement and ability to command attention)\n\nPlease output ONLY a JSON object in this exact structure:\n\n{\n  \"Posture\": \"\",\n  \"Hand Gestures\": \"\",\n  \"Eye Contact\": \"\",\n  \"Vocal Intensity\": \"\",\n  \"Facial Expression\": \"\",\n  \"Overall Presence\": \"\",\n  \"Intensity\": \"\",\n  \"Confidence\": \"\",\n  \"Presence\": \"\"\n}\n\nEach field should contain the rating \"high\", \"medium\", or \"low\" for that frame.\n\nAfter evaluating all frames, can you also give 2–3 specific and actionable suggestions to help improve their delivery, keeping the suggestions practical, short, and realistic?",
